            Hello, my name is Nathan, I am a young and very highly motivated individual looking to explore my personal interests and hobbies surrounding technology and software to pursue a career in web development! I find nderstanding how sites function on both the front-end and back-end extremely intriguing, and when I learn something new in the process of creating my own projects it feels so rewarding. I am optimistic that this excitement will allow me to constantly strive for success in any project I undertake.
            </p>
    
            <p>
            I am currently enrolled in UCF's Coding Bootcamp, which is a six month course dedicated to an accelerated learning of full stack web development. I look forward to completing this course and taking that knowledge with me in my adventures within the field of web development. I want to use the lessons I learn as my tools to build a very long and prosperous career.
            </p>

            <p>
            I hope that you will take the time to view my past projects that I have shared within my "Portfolio" and please reach out to me on my "Contact" page. I would appreciate any new additions to my network, allowing for mutual growth and learning in our journeys.
